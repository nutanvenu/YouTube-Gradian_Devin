# Guardian

Guardian is a family-safety product that connects a parent account to one or
more child devices. The backend signs policy snapshots, the Android child
runtime enforces app/time/web rules locally, and the parent and child Expo
surfaces provide setup, requests, approvals, health, activity, and privacy
controls. Communication Safety is an opt-in Android capability with
privacy-preserving, rules-based signals; iOS capability limits are reported
explicitly.

This repository contains the backend, shared TypeScript contracts, the Expo
mobile application, and the Android Guardian Protection native module.

```

## Prerequisites

The verified local toolchain is:

- Node `22.13.0` and pnpm `10.14.0` (the repository pins both in `.nvmrc` and
  `package.json`).
- Python managed by `uv` using `.python-version` and `.uv-version` (normally
  installed at `$HOME/.local/bin/uv`).
- Docker Engine and Docker Compose, for PostgreSQL 16.
- Java 17, Android SDK/platform tools, and Android build tools `36.0.0` for
  Android builds.
- Android emulators for connected tests and emulator acceptance. The local
  harness uses `emulator-5554` (parent), `emulator-5556` (child), and
  `emulator-5558` (tablet).
- macOS/Xcode is required for iOS compilation, entitlements, and iOS tests.

Do not commit secrets. In particular, keep
`GUARDIAN_POLICY_PRIVATE_KEY` in the ignored `backend/.env`.

## Install dependencies

From the repository root, use a clean shell with Node 22 on `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.13.0/bin:$PATH"
node --version
pnpm --version
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
uv sync --directory backend --locked --extra dev
```

If a local policy signing key is not present, create one without printing it
into source control:

```bash
python scripts/generate-policy-key.py
```

Place the generated value in `backend/.env`:

```text
GUARDIAN_POLICY_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64-encoded-32-byte-key>
```

## Run the backend

Start PostgreSQL and apply migrations:

```bash
docker compose -f backend/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
uv run --directory backend alembic upgrade head
```

Start the API:

```bash
uv run --directory backend uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

In another shell, verify readiness:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/readiness
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ready"}
```

The emulator reaches the host API at `http://10.0.2.2:8000`.

## Run the mobile app

The exact Expo SDK v57 documentation is at
<https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/>.

Start Metro from the mobile package:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.13.0/bin:$PATH"
pnpm --dir apps/mobile start
```

Verify Metro from another shell:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8081/status
```

For a native Android development client, build and install with:

```bash
cd apps/mobile/android
GUARDIAN_POLICY_TRUSTED_PUBLIC_KEYS='{"guardian-dev":"<public-key>"}' \
  ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.guardian.family/.MainActivity
```

The trusted public key is obtained from the backend's
`GET /v1/policy/public-key` response. Never place the private signing key in
the APK or in this README.

For a release build:

```bash
cd apps/mobile/android
GUARDIAN_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=/secure/guardian-release.p12 \
GUARDIAN_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=from-secret-storage \
GUARDIAN_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=guardian-release \
GUARDIAN_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=from-secret-storage \
GUARDIAN_RELEASE_STORE_TYPE=PKCS12 \
GUARDIAN_RELEASE_CERT_SHA256=64-lowercase-hex-certificate-fingerprint \
GUARDIAN_POLICY_TRUSTED_PUBLIC_KEYS='{"guardian-prod-2026-01":"base64-public-key"}' \
GUARDIAN_POLICY_KEY_ID=guardian-prod-2026-01 \
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.guardian.family \
GUARDIAN_DOH_URL=https://dns.guardian.family/dns-query \
GUARDIAN_RELEASE_VERSION_CODE=42 \
GUARDIAN_ENABLE_TEST_FIXTURES=false \
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

All release controls above are process-environment inputs; `-P` properties are
not accepted for them. `GUARDIAN_RELEASE_CERT_SHA256` is the SHA-256 digest of
the configured public release certificate, without colons. The trusted-key map
must contain canonical base64 32-byte public Ed25519 keys and the active key
id. The release task rejects debug signing, fixture mode, placeholder
endpoints, missing public policy authority, and a missing/invalid release
version code. It then verifies signed APK/AAB artifacts, including their final
manifests. Backend-only secrets (including JWT and policy private keys) are
validated by the backend and are never passed to the Android build.

## Emulator harness

Confirm connected devices:

```bash
adb devices
```

Run the native connected test suite:

```bash
cd apps/mobile/android
./gradlew :guardian-protection:connectedDebugAndroidTest --no-daemon
```

Use `agent-device` for authenticated route audits and evidence capture. Start
with the known package/app and continue from the printed accessibility
snapshot:

```bash
agent-device open com.guardian.family --foreground
```

The parent and child sessions use the deep links below after authentication:

```text
guardian://parent/home
guardian://parent/rules
guardian://parent/activity
guardian://parent/health
guardian://child/home
```

For a normal agent-device session, use semantic refs from the latest snapshot,
verify the expected text after each action, and close the session:

```bash
agent-device wait text "Guardian"
agent-device screenshot
agent-device close
```

The full screen inventory, three-interaction matrix, platform limitations, and
evidence status are maintained in
`docs/PRD_REQUIREMENT_MATRIX.md` and `docs/DEVIN_CHECKPOINT.md`.

## Verification commands

The repository intentionally does not claim iOS build, APNs/FCM delivery,
physical-device battery/accessibility, Play reviewer, or store-approval
evidence on a Linux emulator host.
